## Version 0.2.0

- **Technical**
  - Added patching tools to arbitrarily change portraits in scenes. This was used to fix chapter 4, where corrupted Mei is never normally removed from the scene.
  - Created "comic mode" to play CGs with no text box and allow clicking the entire screen (except the `<nav>` element) to advance to the next CG. Comic mode scenes must be identified in the code, the JSON files no nothing of them. You cannot switch between VN-mode and comic mode, each scene must be one or the other.
  - Minor tweaks and improvements.

- **Content**
  - Added additional missing prologue content as separate episodes.
  - Added chapters: Extra 2, Chapter 4, and Chapter 5.
  - Altered certain backgrounds and music.

- **Meta**
  - Added credits to the re-translation team at Hoyostans to the game, README, and Itch.io page.

- **To Do**
  - There should really be something in between scene "parts," like a quick fade out and back in transition.
